# Windows 11 Screen Mode Changer Taskbar Icon
An Autohotkey script that creates a taskbar tray icon in Windows 11 for changing screen mode.

If you have a multi-monitor setup and need to remote into it, you probably need to change the screen layout to one screen only / duplicate.
Windows 10 had a "Project" option in the notification panel which they removed in Windows 11.

This gives you an icon in the taskbar that you can click to call up the screen mode menu.

You'll need AutoHotkey and the two files in this repository.

Download AutoHotkey here: https://autohotkey.com/

I use the latest version.
